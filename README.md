A repo for Team Black Hole.

# Animation

## Background displacement mapping 
Give the illusion of stars flicering in the background

## Spaghettification
Atronaut will move toward the center of the blackhole, scaling down to give the impression of 3 dimensions, while also decelerating and then stopping before fading until transparent

## Scale Adjustment
Add one slider to adjust the filter strength, giving the effect different masses have on gravity
Example: bulge.uniforms.strength = [1 - 4, etc.]
