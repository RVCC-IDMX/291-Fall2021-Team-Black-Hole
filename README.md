# Black Hole Prototype v 0.1
Welcome to the Black Hole Prototype!

Working in my Blajsa Branch for experimentation

This is a visual prototype meant to demonstrate the interactive elements of the Black Hole Project. The display will have the following interactive portions...
- UI Elements
- Slider

The button affordances will begin the spaghettification animation by clicking the on, at which the astronaut will begin the animation cycle; the out will return the astronaut to it's original position. 

The Slider will allow the user to adjust the strength of the black hole present on the screen. 

*While this is a prototype, specific filters and assets are subject to change*

# Animation

## Background Stars
The displacement map, or equal animation, will give the illusion of stars flickering in the background.

## Spaghettification
The astronaut sprite will move toward the center of the blackhole, decelerating and then stopping before fading until transparent. This will mimic the phenomena known as spaghettification.

## Scale Adjustment
Add one slider to adjust the filter strength, giving the effect different masses have on gravity.

Example: bulge.uniforms.strength = [1 - 4, etc.]
